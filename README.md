# Employing Reinforcement Learning for Cuntrupuntal Composition 

## Overview
As an introductory project in machine learning, I employed a reinforcement learning to compose first species counterpoint. 

## Research Mentors and Advisors
- Dr. John Paul-Ore: NC State University, jwore@ncsu.edu
- Dr. Javon Adams: NC State University, jmadams2@ncsu.edu

## Required Libraries
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Music21

## Repository Contents
- **Config.yaml**: Contains the parameters to configure the environment and the Q-learning alorithm. 
- **FSRL.py**: Contains the main Q-Learning Algorithm and the environment configuration. Running this python file will start a new training task, print the resulting composition, and plot the resulting reward curves.
- **Reward.py**: Contains the reward function inspired by first species counterpoint guidelines.
